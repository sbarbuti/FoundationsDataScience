#### Foundations of Data Science/Springboard Capstone Project

##Predicting Tennis Tournament Success

###Problem Definition 
This research will use tennis tournament statistics to learn what statistics best predict the outcome of a tennis match. Analysis of the post match statistics will identify the most important drivers of a match. Potential clients could be coaches or players, media, tennis analysts or even tennis enthusiasts who want to learn the best predictors of success. This analysis can be used prior to match play to determine areas of focus. Future work could include development of a tool to evaluate mid-match statistics.

###Dataset
Data consists of match statistics from the 4 major professional tennis tournaments in 2013 for each player who competed in both the mens and womensâ€™ tournament. Data are available from the Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tennis+Major+Tournament+Match+Statistics).

###Methodology
Research will conduct advanced statistical analysis to determine what match statistics most impact wins and loses. Analysis will also research gender differences and tournament types. Based on research, a regression model or machine learning algorithm will be developed to predict match outcomes. 

###Deliverables
Deliverables will include R code and slide deck presentation available on github.
