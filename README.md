Data includes game statistics for each player who competed in both the mens and womensâ€™ tournament. (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tennis+Major+Tournament+Match+Statistics)


Research will conduct advanced statistical analysis and possibly machine learning algorithms to understand what game statistics most impact wins and loses. Research the variables or combinations of variables that have the most significance when predicting a win or loss.
