##Project Idea

Predicting tennis tournament success. Utilize data to research the main match statistics that impact a win. Research the variables or combinations of variables that have the most significance when predicting a win or loss. Does the research show differences in males versus females or by type of tournament? Data is available for the 4 major professional tennis tournaments in 2013 from the Machine Learning Repository. Data includes game statistics for each player who competed in both the mens and womensâ€™ tournament.
